                <li>motan <br> Cairo's motto/slogan can vary depending on different contexts and 
                    translations, but one of the commonly used mottos for Cairo is:
                    "Umm al-Dunya" (أم الدنيا).
                    This Arabic phrase translates to "Mother of the World" or "Mother of the Universe." 
                    It reflects Cairo's historical significance as one of the world's oldest and most 
                    influential cities, often considered a cultural and economic hub of the Middle East 
                    and North Africa.
