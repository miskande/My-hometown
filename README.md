# My-hometown

My website is contained on 3 webpages. Home, history, and visit page. All pages have the same layout that includes a navigation bar and horizontal carousel that is used from Bootstrap. The carousel gives the website an aesthetic appear with beautiful pictures of Cairo. 
The home page includes the following parts:
1. Short introduction about Cairo. 
2. Transport paragraph to facilitate to the tourist to go around the city, related links to Apple and Android for relevant transport applications.
3. Food recommendation in Cairo, I found it interesting to mention because Egypt is popular for its special food.
4. Motan for Cairo. 

The history page includes the history of the presidents and progress through the ages in Cairo

The visit page includes 7 must-visit places in cairo, a short information about what people can experience in the place, a picture and location.

Color Choices: I chose to have the navigation bar, carousel, and title bar with a black background to make the images look elegant and clear. The content background is beige. I chose light colors so that the text is easier for someone to read.

Challenges faced: The most 3 challenging parts for me was the following:
1. Make the whole content less wide and centered when the user zoom out to the maximum. The problem is solved by setting maximum width for the body  and content with black background. The maximum width is when the website is zoomed with at least 100%, if it is zoomed out with less than 100%, teh content will have automatic margin left and right. 

2. Make the pictures in the carousel and the Visit page have a good dynamic appearance when the user zoom in and out. I decided to resize the picture to appear smaller and bigger with the SAME ratio between width and height. The hardest part was to have this part in the carousel because I needed to know what styling conditions is in each class to avoid overlapping in the styling. 

3. Make the maps for each place in the visit page to be in float with text and positioned on the right top side.
