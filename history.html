            Today Cairo is home to over 20 million people, making it one of the largest 
            and beautiful cities in Africa and the Middle East. Cairo has always been 
            filled with a vibrant population and a great environment for all ages and 
            social levels. Cairo is always famous for its rich history and fascinating 
            city to explore and visit from around the world. On this page, a history of 
            the presidents and progress through the ages in Cairo will be presented briefly.</p>


        <ul class="president">
            <li>
                <h1>Nasser's Era - Building the Future:</h1>
                <p class="history-page-paragraph"><img src="presidents/Gamal_Abdel_Naser.jpg" alt="No pic" class="float-image-pre" >Gamal Abdel El Nasser became leader in Egypt between 1956 -1970 intending to make 
                Egypt an independent and modern country. The Most significant achievement during the 
                period of President Gamal Abd El Nasser is the amazing construction of the Aswan High 
                Dam. This enormous infrastructure project was accomplished in 1970. It showed how 
                powerful and useful the Nile River was to provide a stable water supply and electricity 
                for millions of citizens. Furthermore, it has protected against destructive inundations. 
                Gamal Abd El Naser was aiming to unite all arab countries and challenge the Western 
                influence in the region. </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <h1><b>Sadat's Open Door - Welcoming Change:</b></h1>
                <p class="history-page-paragraph"><img src="presidents/Anwar_Sadat_cropped.jpg" alt="No pic" class="float-image-pre" >During Anwar Sadat's presidency in Egypt, which lasted from 1970 to 1981, the country 
                experienced considerable political, economic, and social changes. One of the enormous 
                changes during his period was the signing of a peace agreement with Israel called the 
                Camp David Accords in 1978. This peace agreement led to the return of the Sinai peninsula 
                to Egyptian control. Another significant change during his period was the foundation of the 
                economic policy "Infitah" or "open-door policy" at the beginning of his presidency in Egypt. 
                This policy aims to increase private enterprise and minimize government control over the 
                investment to increase foreign investment. The positive impact of the open-door policy is 
                to provide access to the advances in technology and decrease unemployment in Egypt. Anwar 
                Sadat's presidency came to an end in 1981 after an Islamic assassination who opposed this 
                peace agreement with Israel and his internal policies.</p>

            <li>
                <h1><b>Mubarak's Era - Coping with Growth:</b></h1>
                <p class="history-page-paragraph"><img src="presidents/Hosni-Mubarak-2009.webp" alt="No pic" class="float-image-pre" >Hosni Mubarak's presidency in Egypt began from 1981 until 2011. During his presidency, 
                he had a significant impact on economic and tourism growth in Egypt, specifically in Cairo. 
                During his rule, important urban projects were initiated to achieve better living standards 
                and develop infrastructure such as building new bridges, establishing public transportation 
                to increase mobility, and constructing new roads. Tourism increased incredibly and was key 
                to a better economy in the city. Despite this, Cairo has faced challenges, including population 
                growth, significantly high unemployment rates, lack of public services in some areas, poverty, 
                and income inequality. These challenges led to the overthrow of Mubarak after the January 25 
                revolution in 2011.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h1><b>El-Sisi's Vision - Shaping Tomorrow:</b></h1>
                <p class="history-page-paragraph"><img src="presidents/180819032827-el-sisi-1.jpg" alt="No pic" class="float-image-pre" >Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's presidency in Egypt began in 2014, until now. Since 2014  several 
                notable impacts on Cairo including providing security and stability for the residents 
                and tourists after facing terrorist attacks and political issues in Cairo. Abdel Fattah 
                el Sisi succeeded in developing the infrastructure in a short period with remarkable 
                improvements by building new roads, bridges, and public transportation. </p>
